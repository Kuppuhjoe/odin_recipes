<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This Korean fried chicken recipe is officially my favorite. I've had 
    every style of fried chicken known to man, so I've always considered 
    myself an expert. No other method I've come across has the same 
    combination of tender, juicy, flavorful chicken and plate-scratching 
    crispiness as this recipe does. It's simply a must-try!</p>
